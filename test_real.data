And while nobody would think of comparing a Dispatch concert to these global events, for their devoted fans the band's 2011 concert tour, the first in a decade, is very big news indeed.\nFor those not aware of what happens when the members of Dispatch - Brad Corrigan, Pete Heimbold and Chad Stokes - get together to play, take a look at what happened during their last hometown appearance, 2004's concert at Boston Hatch Shell. \"The Last Dispatch\" drew an audience in excess of 110,000 people from 25 countries - from as far away as Europe, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The event which was expected to draw about 20,000, became the largest independent music event in history and was documented in a feature film The Last DISPATCH.\n\"It just blows our minds,\" says Heimbold. \"It's amazing to us that people continue to spread the music years after we stopped touring, and we're very grateful that our fans are so passionate.\"\nFounded in 1995 at Middlebury College in Vermont, Dispatch built their incredible following through a grass-roots Diy ethic that wholly ignored the usual routes to rock stardom: major labels, radio airplay, MTV and mainstream media coverage.\nAs the band's fan base grew, they began releasing albums on their own Bomber Records label. Starting with Silent Steeples ('96), followed by Bang Bang ('98), Four-Day Trials ('99) and Who Are We Living For?

The all new tour comes on the heels of her sold out 2010 Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang smash tour which was extended three times, drawing more than 250,000 fans in 44 markets and grossing more than $16 million. Brad Wollack, Josh Wolf and Heather McDonald, friends and regulars on her hit show Chelsea Lately, will join Handler for the 19 date stand-up tour set to kick off on May 10th in Boston.\n\nHandler's new book is a collection of stories by her friends and family about the ridiculous lies Handler has told them over the years. The three comedians performing along side Handler on the tour, Wollack, Wolf and McDonald, all wrote chapters for the book and are writers on Handler\u2019s hit show Chelsea Lately, which is consistently the highest rated program on the E! Network. Each tour stop will include a signing session in support of the new book.\n\nIn 2007, Chelsea launched her very successful latenight series Chelsea Lately for E! and since premiering it has consistently been the Networks most watched series. In March 2011, Chelsea will launch a companion show, After Lately that will follow the outside lives of the series\u2019 stars: Chelsea Handler, Chuy Bravo, and the gaggle of insane personalities who write for and appear regularly with Chelsea every night. The series will also go inside the day-to-day lives of Sarah Colonna, Brad Wollack, Chris Franjola, Heather McDonald, Jeff Wild, Johnny Kansas and Steve Marmalstein as they work and play at the E! studios.\n\nOn March 28, 2010, her three books took the #1, #2, and #3 spots on the New York Times Best Seller lists. Her first book, My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One Night Stands (Bloomsbury), was released in the U.S. and over twenty other countries and became a bestseller for several weeks running. Her follow-up book, Are You There, Vodka? It\u2019s Me, Chelsea (Simon Spotlight, 2008), debuted at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list. Her highly-anticipated third book, Chelsea Chelsea, Bang Bang (Grand Central Publishing), debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestsellers list when it was released in March 2010. All three books remain on the New York Times best seller lists today (hardcover and paperback).\n\nBelvedere Vodka, Chelsea\u2019s drink of choice, is presenting her concert tour. Belvedere also hosts private after-parties for Chelsea's gigs across the country. Known for having a strong point of view on contemporary culture, Belvedere Vodka is a vodka with natural edge, making it the perfect partner for Chelsea and her fans.","vid":1007815,"color":"","phone":"1-800-745-3000 ","startTime":"Tue May 10 20:00:00 UTC 2011","endTime":null,"zurl":"/boston-ma/events/show/167784405-lies-chelsea-handler-told-me-tour-2011"},{"name":"\"Educating Rita\" by Willy Russell","price":"$25-$89 ","private":false,"editors_pick":false,"url":"http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/1011/rita/index.aspx","approved":false,"sc":32,"id":124029345,"images":[],"description":"Rita, a young, brash hairdresser, wants more out of life.

Written towards the end of his life, this is one of the most eloquent of all Shostakovich\u2019s works, almost a self-portrait. It is the testament of a man who experienced the worst the Stalinist regime could do, and survived \u2014 just barely.\n\nMs. Gutman is the living heir to the generation of Russian musicians who experienced the terror first hand, and with her unequaled gift for reaching into the soul of every work she plays, she is the foremost interpreter of this masterpiece.\n\nProkofiev\u2019s ballet Romeo and Juliet is probably the greatest \u201cstory\u201d ballet ever composed. Its music is alternately playful, ribald, searing, and ecstatic, much like the play on which it is based. Benjamin Zander has prepared an extensive suite from the three acts of the ballet, different from what is usually heard in the concert halls, that projects the variety and tragic grandeur of this rich score with the visceral power of an actual staged performance.\n\nThese two extraordinarily gripping works, combined with the mesmerizing presence of Natalia Gutman, guarantee that this concert will be one of the most thrilling and talked-about musical events in Boston this year.

The beloved Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis takes a theme by the great English Renaissance composer and weaves it into a very 20th century setting, in which three groups of strings combine in an astonishing, almost bewildering variety of texture and invention.\n\nThe Polish composer Karol Szymanowski is a fascinating figure in the history of music. He allowed himself to come under a great variety of influences in his life, some of them very exotic indeed, like his fascination with Arabic music. Near the end of his life he sought ultimate inspiration in the folk music of his native country. In his last years he wrote a handful of captivating masterpieces that are among the musical treasures of the Central Europe in the twentieth century, and the Second Violin Concerto is one of the jewels from this late period. Its lush, intoxicating, yet astringent sounds will make an immediate impact on all who have yet to come under its spell. The great Russian violinist Ilya Kaler, a major exponent of this soaring, dauntingly difficult concerto, has made an acclaimed recording of the work and will be making his Boston Philharmonic debut with these concerts.\n\nThe Enigma Variations has always been the best-known and most beloved work of Elgar\u2019s. At times it is wistful, at times riotous, and always Elgar is engaged with the deepest, most genuine of feelings. The richness and variety of its orchestration makes this piece a particular delight for the players too, and the work\u2019s unabashed Englishness, together with that of the Vaughan Williams Tallis Fantasy, gives Mr. Zander the opportunity \u2014 one that he rarely takes \u2014 to indulge in a little sentiment for the land of his birth.\n\n** Please note there will be a pre-concert talk prior to the Sunday, February 27th performance at 1:45pm.","vid":17358,"color":"","phone":"(617) 236-0999","startTime":"Sun Feb 27 15:00:00 UTC 2011","endTime":null,"zurl":"/cambridge-ma/events/show/139097945-boston-philharmonic-orchestra-concert-3-vaughan-williams-szymanowski-elgar"},{"name":"St Patrick's Day Entertainment Cruise","price":"$30","private":false,"editors_pick":false,"url":"","approved":false,"sc":0,"id":165342665,"images":[],"description":"What better way to celebrate St Patrick's day than on a boat in Boston Harbor?

Get ready for the best challenge you ever took. Take the dare! We will begin check-in at 11:00 and will be taking registration up to the start of the race. Look for us in the light blue t-shirts. You must wear your Urban Dare shirts throughout the race, which we will give you at check-in. You should bring a cell phone and a digital camera to show your pictures at the end of the race. A cell phone camera will work. Maps are also handy and you should have someone to call to help look up clues. I also recommend a pen or pencil to take notes. The Urban Dare start is unique. We will ask multiple choice trivia questions and you will move into A, B, C or D areas depending on your answer. Get a few answers correct and you are on your way. This gives us a staggered start, but we'll be through it quickly. You may not use your phones at this stage of the race. Once you are out of the starting blocks, you will pick up your clue sheets and be on your way. You can call friends as much as you want for help on clues. For the checkpoints that mention a dare, you must check in with the Urban Dare official, accomplish your task, and get your passport stamped before moving on. On checkpoints that mention a photo, you must get a photo with both team members to show you were both there. This is a team race. You must be together throughout the race. You may walk, run or use public transportation to get to checkpoints. At checkpoints with dares, you must accomplish a task and get your passport stamped to move on to the next checkpoint. Dares range from throwing a bulls-eye, doing a climbing wall, completing a puzzle or eating something (things people like, not bugs). We expect the winners will finish the race in about 2 hours and most of you will finish under 4 hours.

It was the first concert hall designed with acoustical principles in mind and is regarded as one of the two or three finest halls in the world. With the exception of the wooden floors, the Hall is built of brick, steel, and plaster, with only a moderate amount of decoration.\r\n\r\nIt seats 2,625 people during the BSO season and 2,371 during the Pops season.\r\n\r\nThe first home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was the Old Boston Music Hall which was threatened in 1893 by a city road-building/rapid transit project. That summer, the Orchestra's founder, Major Henry Lee Higginson, organized a corporation to finance a new and permanent home for the orchestra. Symphony Hall opened on October 15, 1900, with an inaugural gala led by music director Wilhelm Gericke. The architects, McKim, Mead \u0026 White of New York, engaged Wallace Clement Sabine, a young assistant professor of physics at Harvard, as their acoustical consultant, and Symphony Hall became the first auditorium designed in accordance with scientifically derived acoustical principles.\r\n\r\nWidely regarded as one of the two or three finest concert halls in the world, the walls of the stage slope inward to help focus the sound. The side balconies are shallow so as not to trap any of the sound, and the recesses of the coffered ceiling, along with the statue-filled niches along the three sides, help to distribute the sound throughout the hall. The 16 replicas of Greek and Roman statues are related in some way to music, art, or literature. They were placed in the niches as part of an appreciation of the frequently quoted words, \"Boston, the Athens of America,\" written by Bostonian William Tudor in the early 19th century. The Symphony Hall organ, an Aeolian Skinner designed by G. Donald Harrison and installed in 1949, is considered one of the finest concert hall organs in the world.\r\n\r\nA couple of interesting points for observant concert-goers: Beethoven is the only composer whose name was inscribed on one of the plaques that trim the stage and balconies; the other plaques were left empty since it was felt that only Beethoven's popularity would remain unchanged. The initials \"BMH\" for \"Boston Music Hall\", as the building was originally to have been called, appear on the stairwell banisters at the Huntington Avenue side, originally planned as the main entrance. The old Boston Music Hall was gutted only after the new building, Symphony Hall, was opened.","movies":[],"types":["Auditorium"],"phone":"(617) 266-1492","cuisines":[],"longitude":-71.08518,"showtimes":[],"parent_id":null,"address":"301 Massachusetts Ave.","zurl":"/boston-ma/venues/show/17592-boston-symphony-hall","state":"MA"},{"city":"Boston","name":"Rose Kennedy Greenway","latitude":42.356,"zip":"02110","private":false,"timezone":"US/Eastern","url":"http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/index.htm","country":"United States","id":933611,"images":[{"url":"http://www.zvents.com/images/internal/3/7/2/3/img_713273_thumb.jpg?resample_method=","height":null,"width":null}],"description":"When Boston's Big Dig project plunged previously elevated roadways underground, the city found itself rich in prime urban land.
